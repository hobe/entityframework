This sample shows two different unit test options:
﻿
1. **Create your own test doubles**: You find the code using test doubles in the folder "TestDoubles"

2. **Use a mock framework to create test doubles**: You find the code using the MOQ framework in the "Mock" folder


Code which is used by both options is located within the "Shared" folder
